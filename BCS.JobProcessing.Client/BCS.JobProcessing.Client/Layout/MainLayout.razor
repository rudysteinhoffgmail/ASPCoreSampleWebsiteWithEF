    // Represents a segment of UI content, implemented as a delegate that writes the
    // content to a Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Rendering.RenderTreeBuilder.
    // Parameters:
    // builder:
    // The Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Rendering.RenderTreeBuilder to which the content should be written.

    // 1. Delegate: A delegate in C# is a type that represents references to methods with a 
    //    specific parameter list and return type. Delegates are used to pass methods as arguments to other methods.
    // 2. RenderFragment: In Blazor, RenderFragment is a delegate that takes a RenderTreeBuilder 
    //    as a parameter. The RenderTreeBuilder is used to build the render tree, which is the internal representation 
    //    of the UI that Blazor uses to render components.
    // 3. Segment of UI Content: A RenderFragment represents a segment of UI content. 
    //    It is a reusable piece of UI that can be rendered within a component. 
    //    This allows for dynamic and flexible UI composition.

    [Parameter]
    // Defines a parameter of type RenderFragment to hold the content 
    // to be rendered inside the layout
    public RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }
